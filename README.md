# Project Title

* Road Trippin'

## Description

* This single page application is designed to be used as a traveler's reference for visiting national parks within the United States of America.

* National parks are fetched from the National Parks Service API and rendered to the page nine at a time      (nine additional parks at a time can be rendered upon clicking "LoadMore").

* Users can click on an individual park and display the park's description, activities, cost, weather, contact information, and a link to directions. 

* Users can add parks to a wishlist ("Where I'm Going" via "Add to my trip"). 

* Upon marking a park as visited ("Where I've Been" via "I've already been"), users can rate the park on a 5 star scale.

* Users can search for parks by (USA) state using a controlled form.
